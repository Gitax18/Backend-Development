## Project Structure
- **1_Introduction**: Core Node.js project with a simple HTTP server that handles form submissions.
- **2_Express**: Contains practice projects for Express.js.
    - *1_revision*: Basic HTTP server with multiple routes.
    - *2_temp_engine*: Implementation of MVC architecture, using EJS as the templating engine.
    - *3_mongoDB*: Initially built with MySQL & Sequelize, currently migrating to MongoDB.
